Assignment: 

Task 1 - Mindset / Planning: Your client is seeking your guidance, take us on your journey and
thought process.
Case: Your client is building a new finance system and are still currently supporting a legacy
system in the meantime. An extensive UI end-to-end & API automation suite exists for the legacy
system but tests are slowly starting to break as new features are developed. Simultaneously you
need ensure that features for the new system are thoroughly tested.
● What challenges can you identify?
● What’s your plan of action, how are you going to ensure testing/ releases remain
efficient?
● How will you strike the balance between automation for the new & legacy system?
Conditions:
● This is a new client and your first week.
● Single tester in the team (you).
● 2-week sprint.
● There’s no automation for the new system - tasked to you.
Note:
● Please list any assumptions you make for the given scenario.

Task 2 - Test Automation: Let’s dive into some automated tests. Include your source-code during
submission. The playing field is open when it comes to which tool you use, however if you’re
comfortable with Playwright then it would be nice to use this to automate the test cases (API/
Web) all the while keeping your implementation inline with the restrictions/ languages outlined
below.
Test Cases:
● You’ll write 3 UI web tests.
● You’ll write 3 API web tests.
Rules:
● UI tests via https://www.saucedemo.com.
● API tests via https://reqres.in.
● Provide a clear README for your automation solution.
Tech:
● Tool: [Your choice] OR [Playwright] Restriction: No “Record and Play” tools
● Language (pick one): [C#] [Typescript] [ Javascript] [Java] [Python]
Note:
● Please list any assumptions you make for the given scenario.
Bonus
To have the tests up and running CI/CD
environment of your choice. If you opt to undergo
the Bonus please then be ready to share this
implementation during the interview.

What do we evaluate?
- Ability to build architecture from scratch.
- Testing and validation skills.
- Codebase maintainability, repetition, and
readability.

Assumptions made: 
1. When defining locators the preference was given to data-test attributes as such attributes are usually added to the elements specifically to use them for the ustomation testing
2. Credentials used to authenticate with the websit are not sensitive data and for the simplicity were put in the source code unencrypted
